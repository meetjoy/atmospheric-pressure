With a tissue she covered her left nostril's tone,
A gentle murmur, a sound like a lone cyclone,
He pondered, should he offer a tissue, unknown,
Yet hesitation held him, the awkwardness sown.

Then with a tissue, her right nostril she'd address,
He extended a tissue, a gesture to impress,
All tissues gone, kindness his heart did possess,
She smiled, her eyes sparkled, in this shared tenderness.

"All due to atmospheric pressure," she chimed with grace,
A whimsical twist to the moment's embrace,
In this exchange, a connection they'd trace,
Ambiguous kindness woven in time's delicate lace.
